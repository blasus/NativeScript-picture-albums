# NativeScript picture albums
The intention is to build a simple application that allows users to create
picture albums and store their favorite pictures.

**We want the user to be able to do:**

1. Create picture albums (accept Name + Description)
2. List created albums
3. View images of the albums
4. Add and remove images to/from the album

To add images to the album, we will allow the user to perform
string searches and select images from the search results to be added
to the selected album. Image searches can be conducted using the
free API from: https://pixabay.com/api/docs/ (creating an account is
needed, even though it’s free. If you have preference for any other
image search API, feel free to use alternatives)

**Optional extras:**

5. Keep albums stored on a proper database
To keep these albums in a database, you can consider using
firebase - https://firebase.google.com/pricing/?hl=en-uk - no
authentication/security mechanisms are needed. If you have
preference for other services, feel free to use alternatives
6. Allow users to view and add images to any album stored on the
aforementioned database (i.e., I would be able to see your created
albums and also upload images to them, and vice-versa)
7. Allow the user to take a picture from his own device and store it to the
album. It can be stored in base64 encoding on the same database.

**Considerations**

We are aware of the short development time offered, but we will consider
the approach taken and everything that was delivered. Items 5 to 7 are
optional but if there’s time for them, they are a big plus. If you want to work
on the extra points you can count on an extra day to do so, if needed.
The presentation of the user interfaces can be crude but if you are able to
present a reasonable layout, that will of course also be considered.
